# PFQuest for WotLK 3.3.5

**Unified quest database suite for World of Warcraft 3.3.5 with automated quest capture and live database building.**

## About This Repository

This repository contains **two complementary quest addons** maintained exclusively by XiusTV:

1. **pfQuest-wotlk** - Core quest database for WotLK 3.3.5
2. **pfQuest-bronzebeard** - Ascension Bronzebeard realm-specific extension

Both addons feature advanced quest capture systems that learn new quests as you play, making them permanent for all characters.

**⚠️ This is an independent project.** The original pfQuest developer (Shagu) is not involved with these enhanced versions.

## 🎯 How Quest Capture Works

### In-Game Capture

1. Accept a quest (capture system automatically detects it)
2. Complete objectives (system tracks where you killed/collected)
3. Turn in quest (system records completion)
4. Data is saved to SavedVariables

### Making Captures Permanent

Captured data is saved per-character but can be shared:

**Option 1: Export & Share**
1. Run `/pfquest capture export`
2. Data is copied to your clipboard as Lua code
3. Share with community or save for backup

**Option 2: External Merger Tool** (Recommended)
1. Navigate to `Interface\pfQuest-Tools\dist\`
2. Run `pfQuest Merger Tool.exe`
3. Click "Start Monitoring"
4. When you close WoW, captured quests are automatically merged into the addon database
5. Next launch, all characters have access to captured quests!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "AddOn using too much memory" Warning

Set Script Memory to `0` (no limit) in character selection screen
This is normal - pfQuest loads entire database on startup but doesn't grow over time

### Quest Not Showing on Map

1. Check auto-tracking mode (should be "All Quests" for automatic)
2. Click "Reset" button in questlog
3. Try `/db clean` then `/db show` to refresh

### Captured Quests Not Appearing

1. Run `/pfquest capture status` to verify data was captured
2. Use merger tool to integrate captures into database
3. Reload UI (`/reload`) after merger completes

### Performance Issues

1. Use slim language downloads instead of full packages
2. Disable unused addons
3. Clear WoW cache folder

---

## 🚀 What's Next

* **Northrend Quest Expansion** - Capturing all WotLK 70-80 quests
* **Community Database** - Sharing captured quest data
* **Enhanced Capture UI** - More detailed statistics and filtering
* **Automatic Updates** - Cloud-sync for quest captures
* **Integration Tools** - Better export/import functionality
